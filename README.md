## Forms, Pseudocode, and more!
<p>
    I spent a portion of my time planning out how this project was going to look and function like.
    Transfering my thoughts to paper then over to a text editor and finally to vscode. I strengthed
    my ability to problem solve and take on tasks pieces at a time to get the end result. I spent some
    time going over forms in this project, learning different ways to collect data and how to style the
    form.
